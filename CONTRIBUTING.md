## Before You Start Contributing

To save time and avoid duplicate efforts, please follow these steps:

1. **Check Existing Issues and PRs**
    - Browse through open and closed issues
    - Review current Pull Requests
    - Use the search function with relevant keywords to find similar proposals

2. **Discuss Major Changes**
    - For small fixes (typos, minor bugs) you can create a PR directly
    - For substantial changes, start by creating an Issue first:
        - Describe what you want to implement
        - Explain why it's valuable
        - Outline your implementation approach
    - Wait for maintainers' feedback
    - This helps to:
        - Ensure the changes align with project goals
        - Get early implementation guidance
        - Avoid wasted effort
        - Align on technical decisions

3. **Get Confirmation**
    - Wait for maintainers' approval comment
    - Clarify any uncertainties
    - Only proceed with implementation after getting the green light

This approach helps:

- Save everyone's time
- Keep the project coherent
- Prevent conflicting changes
- Ensure higher code quality
